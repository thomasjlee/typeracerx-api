# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Seed data for development
# for n in (1..20)
#   name = "player#{n}"
#   wpm = rand(100) + 30
#   accuracy = (rand() * 100).floor
#   HighScore.create(name: name, wpm: wpm, accuracy: accuracy)
# end
